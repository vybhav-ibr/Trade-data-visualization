# Trade-data-visualization
A tableau project to analyze and visualize the trade data of India for 4 consecutive years(2018-2021).
The datset contains the volums of trade for each category with every country india traded with.
The data was obtained from Department of Commerce, Government of India, but it was extracted by suing a web scraper built by a kaggle user named lakshyaad(https://www.kaggle.com/lakshyaag).
As the notebook provided is of the .twbx format, it can be directly executed on any machine, the dataset is included in the workbbok.
Although the data is available for over ten years(2010-2021) only the recent data was used in the light of keeping the project lightweight.
Any additional analysis required can be done directly from the Dashboard using the action filters.
